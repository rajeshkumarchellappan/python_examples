Day 1 Convective Outlook

1134 PM CST Thu Dec 14 2017

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorm threat is less than 10%.

...Discussion...

Southern stream has shifted to fairly low latitudes with a
substantial upper trough expected to settle into northern Mexico.
This feature will begin to eject toward south TX late in the day1
period but insufficient moisture/instability will prevent
thunderstorm development across the south-central US.

Elsewhere, cool, stable conditions are not conducive for deep
convection.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms will be possible across the middle and upper
Texas coast late Saturday evening and across southwest Louisiana
Saturday night into early Sunday morning.

...DISCUSSION...
A low-amplitude upper-ridge will move eastward from the Great Plains
into the Mississippi Valley on Saturday as an upper-level trough
moves across northern Mexico. This feature will reach the southern
Plains Saturday night with a 40 to 55 kt low-level jet strengthening
ahead of the trough. As the trough moves quickly northeastward,
low-level moisture over the western Gulf of Mexico will advect
northward to the upper Texas Coast around midnight. Isolated
thunderstorms may develop with this convection spreading eastward
into southwestern Louisiana during the overnight period. Although
surface dewpoints are forecast to reach the lower 60s F in far
southwestern Louisiana during the 09Z to 12Z time-frame, a sharp
surface inversion will be in place evident on forecast soundings.
This will keep any convection elevated in nature. For this reason, a
severe threat is not expected early Sunday morning.

Elsewhere across the CONUS, thunderstorm activity is not forecast
during the day 2 period.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms will likely develop on Sunday across parts of the
central Gulf Coast region including the lower Mississippi Valley. A
few damaging wind gusts and a marginal tornado threat will be
possible.

...Lower Mississippi Valley...
A shortwave trough will move quickly northeastward into the mid
Mississippi Valley on Sunday as southwest mid-level flow remains in
place across the Gulf Coast Region. At the surface, moisture
advection will continue across the lower Mississippi Valley where
surface dewpoints are forecast to reach the lower to mid 60s F
across southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi by midday.
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are forecast to be ongoing in
southwestern Louisiana at the beginning of the period with this
convection spreading eastward into the lower Mississippi Valley by
early afternoon. NAM and GFS forecast soundings at New Orleans,
Louisiana and Mobile, Alabama at 21Z Sunday afternoon show weak
instability with strong deep-layer shear. Although MLCAPE values are
only forecast to be in the 250 to 500 J/kg range, 0-6 km shear
values could be as high as 50 kt. This would be enough for a
marginal severe threat making isolated damaging wind gusts possible
with the stronger thunderstorms. 0-1 km shear of 25 to 30 kt will
also make storm rotation possible and a marginal tornado threat can
not be ruled out. As moisture advection continues and the shear
environment is maintained during the evening and overnight period, a
marginal severe threat could persist across the region.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA...

...Synopsis...
...Portions of Central CA...

An upper ridge over the western U.S. will break down this period as
a shortwave trough moves over the Pacific Northwest. Overnight this
trough will dig southward, becoming oriented from southwest MT to
southern CA by Saturday morning. Strong deep-layer northerly flow on
the back side of the trough will overspread the Pacific Northwest
and much of California. Elevated to locally critical conditions are
expected to develop over the mountains and foothills in the vicinity
of the Bay Area along the central CA coast and adjacent portions of
the Sacramento Valley late in the period. In higher elevations, RH
values will begin to fall into the 20-35 percent range early
Saturday morning as sustained north winds increase to 15-25 mph with
higher gusts. 

...Portions of Southern CA...

High pressure over the Great Basin this morning will weaken later
today as the upper ridge breaks down ahead of the shortwave trough
moving into the Pacific Northwest. Gusty offshore winds will
continue across the southern CA mountains and foothills this morning
and several hours of critical conditions are expected. While wind
speeds are then expected to weaken during the afternoon and evening,
conditions will remain very dry and elevated fire weather conditions
will continue for much of the period, especially in higher
elevations where overnight RH recovery will be poor.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF CENTRAL CALIFORNIA...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA...

...Synopsis...
Strong northerly deep-layer flow on the back side of an amplifying
upper trough over the western U.S. will overspread much of the
California on Saturday. At the surface, a cold front will move
southeast across the Great Basin and high pressure will build over
the region late in the period. Further east, a lee low will develop
over the central High Plains and a tightening surface pressure
gradient will aid in the development of breezy south/southwesterly
winds across portions of the central and southern Plains. 

...Portions of Central into Northern CA...

Elevated fire weather conditions will be widespread from the central
coast into the Sacramento and portions of the San Joaquin Valleys as
gusty north to northeast winds overspread the region and RH values
fall into the 15-35 percent range. In the vicinity of the Bay Area
mountains and foothills, critical fire weather conditions are
expected to develop during the morning hours and continue into
Sunday morning.  The strongest north winds are expected to align
with lower RH values in this area. Sustained north/northeast winds
of 20-30 mph with higher gusts will be possible in the mountains and
foothills, where RH values will fall into the 15-25 percent range.
Winds will remain gusty into the overnight hours and RH recovery
will be poor in the mountains.

...Portions of Southern CA...

As high pressure settles back into the Great Basin Saturday night,
the pressure gradient will again become favorable for gusty offshore
winds. Wind speeds are expected to increase across the L.A. and
Ventura County mountains after dark and sustained speeds of 20-30
mph with higher gusts are expected. RH values across the mountains
will remain low, in the 10-20 percent range. As a result, critical
fire weather conditions are expected to develop once again Saturday
night into Sunday morning. 

...Portions of the Central/Southern High Plains...

Breezy south/southwest winds are expected during the afternoon as a
lee low develops over eastern CO. A dry airmass will be in place and
warm afternoon temperatures resulting in boundary-layer mixing to
around 2-3kft will allow for RH values falling into the 20-30
percent range. Sustained wind speeds of 10-15 mph with higher gusts
will result in widespread elevated to locally critical fire weather
conditions during the afternoon.
